# DrakEngine
Drake + Engine = DrakEngine. Here be dragons.

This repository is made for demonstrative purposes and storage of pet project.

## How to build
Use premake5 with premake5.lua in the project root folder.
Works with cmake and clion plugins.

You need to have VulkanSDK preinstalled and submodules synced.

## Acknowledgments

Most of the DrakEngine code and ideas at is based on [Hazel engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) made by [Yan Chernikov](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw). Check him out, he is a very humble and great content creator in gamedevelopment self-education field.
So consider this repository and engine as a possible result of how it could go, if the Vulkan and MacOS support has been implemented into Hazel engine.
